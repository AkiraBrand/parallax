# parallax

This is a project I did for a MintBean hackathon to experiment with the Parallax.js library. I anchored images as "base layers"
and chose complimentary colors that would be effected by where the user drags their mouse around the screen to overlay them, 
creating a psychadelic effect. 

next steps: Use more of the 3d effect in different z-indexes across the page!
